            <p class="quote">Section 1:</p>
            <p class="quote">"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."</p>
            
            <p class="quote">Section 2:</p>
            <p class="quote">"Slavery and Involuntary servitude is banned. People who commited crimes and are in jail are subject to be slaves. Congress is allowed to reinforce this law with proper collective vote."</p>
            
            <h4>To Over Simplify it</h4>
            
            <p>Slavery and Involuntary servitude were deemed unconstitutional; unless you have committed any crimes. This meant anyone in jail was subjected to become a slave.</p>
            <p>This Amendment also allowed Congress to reinforce this law whenever they saw fit, of course only with the proper collective votes. </p>

            <p>The American Civil War was one of the most devastating events in United States history. It changed the entire fate of the nation and created the America we know and love today. This video shows an alternate reality where the south won the civil war.  </p>
            
            <h4>The Impact of the 13th Amendment</h4>
            <p> This amendment has impacted the world greatly. The biggest thing this was responsible for, if you don't know already, is that it abolished slavery; and since most slaves were being used for their labor, the nation's economy took a stabbing. Most factories and plantations relied on Slaves.</p>
            <p>While it neutralized the conflict going between the north and south, the introduction of Jim Crow laws only emphasizes the South's reliance on blacks. Segregation was stronger than ever now that certain things such as bathrooms, schools, etc were being separated by color. However, with the Jim Crow Laws being outlawed in 1964 people began to accept one another for who they are. But despite it, we do still have large pockets of racism sprinkled throughout the country.</p>
            
            <h4>Was the Amendment Successful?</h4>
            
            <p>It could be said that this Amendment was somewhat a success since it did accomplish its goal of eliminating slavery, but racism still remained for many years after.</p>

            <h4>Some Quick Fun Facts</h4>
            <ul>
                
            
            <li><p> Mississippi finally signed the amendment in 1995 making it official and it was certified in 2013. Meaning Slavery was legal 131 years after the amendment was passed on the state of Mississipi</p></li>
